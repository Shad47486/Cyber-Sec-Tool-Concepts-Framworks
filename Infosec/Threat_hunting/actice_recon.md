# What is active reconnaissance?

* Requires direct engagement with the target and is not discreet.
  * Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

* Activities of passive recon include:
  * Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
  * Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
  * Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
