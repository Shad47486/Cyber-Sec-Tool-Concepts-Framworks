# What is a Router?

- It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them.
  - Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks.
  - Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.
    - It does this by using routing (hence the name router!).

## What is a Switch?

- Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet.
  - Plugs into a switch port.

- Switches are usually found in larger networks such as businesses, schools, or similar-sized networks, where there are many devices to connect to the network.
- Switches can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into.

- Switches are much more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters).
  - Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port.
    - This way, when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port like a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target, thus reducing network traffic.

### Star Topology

- The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub.
- Commonly found today because of its reliability and scalability - despite the cost.

### Bus Topology

- This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  - Similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.

### Ring Topology (Token Topology)

- Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
