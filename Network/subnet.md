# What is Subnetting?

- Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself.
  - Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.
    - As we can recall, an IP address is made up of four sections called octets.
    - The same goes for a subnet mask which is also represented as a number of four bytes (32 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (0-255).

- Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
  - Identify the network address
  - Identify the host address
  - Identify the default gateway
