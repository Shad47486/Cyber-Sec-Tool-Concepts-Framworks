This is not a comic book! Would you mind going and checking what's going on! Please...

Sir, you need to observe the traffic with Snort and identify the anomaly first. Then you can create a rule to stop the brute-force attack. GOOD LUCK!

Answer the questions below
First of all, start Snort in sniffer mode and try to figure out the attack source, service and port.

Then, write an IPS rule and run Snort in IPS mode to stop the brute-force attack. Once you stop the attack properly, you will have the flag on the desktop!

Here are a few points to remember:

Create the rule and test it with "-A console" mode.
Use "-A full" mode and the default log path to stop the attack.
Write the correct rule and run the Snort in IPS "-A full" mode.
Block the traffic at least for a minute and then the flag file will appear on your desktop.

1. Stop the attack and get the flag (which will appear on your Desktop)
