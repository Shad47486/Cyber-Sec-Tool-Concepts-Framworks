# What is a Security Engineer?

- Owns the overall security of an organization. The main person responsible for securing an organization's digital assets.

- Ensures that the organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times.

- Devises strategies and creates systems that minimize the risk posed by cyber security threats to an organization.

- Periodically conducts tests to ensure the robustness of the cyber security posture of an organization, identifies weak points, and prepares mitigations.

- Develops and implements secure network solutions.

- Architects and engineers trustworthy, reliable, and secure systems.

- Collaborates and coordinates with other teams to establish security protocols across the organization.

- Qualifications Required for a Security Engineer:
  - 0-2 years of experience with IT administration, helpdesk, networks or security operations
  - Basic understanding of computer networks, operating systems, and programming.
  - Basic understanding of security concepts such as Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC).

## Core Responsibilities of a Security Engineer

- Asset Management/Asset Inventory
  - Managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets
    - Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has.
    - They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.

- Security Policies
  - An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound security posture.
  - Helps the organization create security policies based on established Security Principles
    - These policies are then implemented organization-wide, and the security engineer ensures that the implementation follows the letter and spirit of the policies.
  - Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs.
    - In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks.

- Secure by Design
  - The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy.
    - This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture, ensures the orgs Windows, Linux, and AD are hardened, and software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

- Secuirty Assessmen & Assurance
  - To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture.
    - While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities, creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.

### How to perform Continuous Improvement?

- Ensuring Awareness
  - A security engineer might be tasked with maintaining a certain security awareness level in the organization
    - Humans are the building blocks of any organization, and as is often said, humans are the weakest link in an organization's security.
  - A security engineer periodically runs awareness sessions targeting primarily social engineering attacks to ensure that humans don't make mistakes that can compromise an organization's security.
    - Awareness sessions are also organized for specific teams to ensure they follow security principles related to their area of expertise, like secure software development or secure network architecture.

- Managing Risk
  - A security engineer is often tasked with identifying security risks, determining their likelihood and impact, and finding solutions to minimize those risks.
    - The executive management of most organizations looks at security from the lens of minimizing risks.
  - Risks may not allows be fixed so sometimes a securirty engineer looks to mitigate the risk by doing different tasks or ultimelty they accept the risk.

- Change Managment
  - To ensure a robust security posture, the security engineer keeps track of changes in the organization's digital assets that can affect the security posture and takes measures to improve the security posture with the organization's evolution.

- Vulnerability Management
  - New software versions are released, and vulnerabilities are found in the older versions.
    - The security engineer's job often includes monitoring vulnerabilities across the organization and planning to patch or minimize their risk.
      - Vulnerabilities are generally patched according to severity

- Compliance and Audits
  - Depending on the industry, clientele, and location of the organization, it might be subject to various compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, NIST-800-53, and more
  - A security engineer works closely with both internal and external auditors to detect any non-compliance issues and effectively address them.
    - They are  also responsible for upholding the organization's security certifications as needed.

#### Additional Roles and Responsibilities

- Managing Security Tooling
  - A security engineer might sometimes be required to configure or fine-tune security tools such as SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, EDRs, and more.
    - In some organizations, that might also be the primary responsibility of a security engineer.
      - In such a role, a security engineer might also be making decisions or providing input to decision-makers about tools to procure based on the organization's requirements and the engineer's assessments of competitive tools.

- Tabletop Exercise
  - Often conducted to gauge the operational readiness of an organization from a security point of view.
    - Certain scenarios are identified to be exercised, and security team members must explain their respective roles in the scenarios under discussion.
      - EX: A scenario might include the compromise of an endpoint device through a phishing email.
        - All the team members will then explain their respective steps per the organization's playbooks.
          - The security engineer is sometimes required to conduct these exercises.

- Disaster Recovery and Crisis Management
  - A robust security posture requires organizations to plan for untoward incidents, disasters, or crises.
  **The top priority of the executive management is to maintain business continuity**
  - A security engineer might be involved in disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management planning as part of the different compliance frameworks and the organization's internal policies.
    - The role of a security engineer in these areas might differ depending on the organization.

#### ﻿﻿Information Security Frameworks

* Provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the org's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, & enforced within the org.
  * This is includes:
    * Policies:
      * A formal statement that outlines an org's goals, principles, & guidelines for achieving specific objs.
    * Standards:
      * A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.
    * Guidelines:
      * A doc that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objs.
    * Procedures:
      *  Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
    *  Baselines:
      *  A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

* Developing Governance Documents:
  * Identify the scope and purpose:
    * Determine what the doc will cover and why it is needed.
    * EX: A password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords.
      * In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.
  * Research and review
    * Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, & best practices to ensure your doc is comprehensive & up-to-date.
    * Review existing policies, procedures, & other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.
  * Draft the document
    * Develop an outline and start drafting the doc, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, & baselines.
    * Ensure the doc is specific, actionable, and aligned with the org's goals and values.
  * Review and approval
    * Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management.
