# What is the Burp Suite?

* Captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server.
  * By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections.
  * The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.
    * Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web & mobile application penetration testing.
    * Industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).

* Comes in Community (free) Edition, Professional (Unrestricted Version of Community) edition, & Enterprise (Continous scanning) Edition.
  * Burp Suite Enterprise continous scanning is similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning
  * Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.
